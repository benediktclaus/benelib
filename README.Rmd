## My personal R library
The goal of `benelib` is to make my life considerably easier. This package includes various helper functions for `ggplot2` plots, RStudio projects or R Markdown templates and a few things more.

## Installation

You can install and load the released version of `benelib` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("benediktclaus/benelib")
library(benelib)
```


## Examples
### Color and fill scales
One of the main reasons for this package to exist is the abilty to change `ggplot2`'s default color and fill scales to a given corporate design.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

palmer_penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_personal()
```

### Plot themes
Another nice addition is my personal `ggplot2` theme.

```{r}
palmer_penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_personal() +
  theme_bene()
```
